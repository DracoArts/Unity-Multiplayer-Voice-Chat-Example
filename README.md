#  Unity Multiplayer Voice Chat Example
 Photon Voice Chat 2 is a high-performance, real-time voice communication solution designed for multiplayer games and applications. Integrated with the Photon Engine, it enables seamless voice chat between players with low latency, high-quality audio, and efficient bandwidth usage. It supports cross-platform communication, making it ideal for multiplayer games on PC, consoles, and mobile device

 Photon Voice 2 is a real-time voice chat SDK designed for multiplayer games and applications. It enables players to communicate with low latency, high-quality audio, and cross-platform support.

 # Key Features:
## 1 Real-Time Voice Communication

- Enables instant voice chat between players in the same room or session.

- Supports both peer-to-peer and server-based voice transmission.

## 2 High-Quality Audio

- Adjustable audio codecs (Opus by default) for optimal sound quality.

- Configurable bitrate, sampling rate, and frame size for balancing quality and bandwidth.

## 3 Low Latency & Efficient Bandwidth Usage

- Optimized network protocols ensure minimal delay in voice transmission.

- Dynamic bandwidth adjustment to reduce lag and packet loss.

## 4 Cross-Platform Support

- Works across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and consoles.

- Compatible with Unity, Unreal Engine, and custom game engines.

## 5 Voice Activity Detection (VAD) & Noise Suppression

- Automatically detects when a player is speaking to reduce unnecessary transmissions.

- Optional noise suppression for clearer voice quality.

## 6 Echo Cancellation & Audio Effects

- Built-in echo cancellation to prevent feedback loops.

- Optional voice effects (pitch shifting, 3D spatial audio, etc.).

Secure & Encrypted Communication

Optional end-to-end encryption for secure voice chats.

## 7 Scalable & Cloud-Ready

- Works with Photon Cloud and Photon Server for large-scale multiplayer games.

- Supports load balancing and region-based matchmaking.

## Easy Integration

- Simple API for quick implementation.

- Works seamlessly with Photon Unity Networking (PUN) and Fusion.

## 10 Customizable & Extensible

- Adjust voice transmission settings per user (priority, volume, mute/unmute).

- Extend functionality with custom audio filters and processing.
# How It Works:
- Players join a Photon Room.

- Voice streams are transmitted peer-to-peer or through relays.

- Audio is encoded/decoded in real-time with Opus.

- Optional features like mute, volume control, and spatial effects can be applied.

## Use Cases:
ðŸŽ® Multiplayer Games (FPS, MMO, Battle Royale)

ðŸ’¬ Social Apps & Virtual Worlds (VR Chat, Metaverse)

ðŸ“¢ Team Coordination (Esports, Co-op Games)

## How to Set Up Photon Voice 2 (Conceptual Steps)
- Install Photon Voice 2 SDK

- Initialize Voice Connection in your gameâ€™s networking logic.

- Join a Voice Room alongside the game session.

- Configure Audio Settings (codec, bitrate, VAD).

- Handle Player Mute/Volume (optional features).

# Installation & Setup
- Import Photon Voice 2

- Configure Photon App Settings

- Navigate to PhotonVoice â†’ PhotonServerSettings.

- Paste your Photon App ID (from the Photon Dashboard) into the Voice App ID field.

- Add Voice to Player Prefab

- Attach the PhotonVoiceView component to your player prefab (alongside PhotonView).

- Add an AudioSource for local playback (optional for advanced setups).
# Basic Workflow
## Initialize Voice

- Call PhotonVoiceNetwork.Connect() after PUN/Fusion connects (e.g., in OnJoinedRoom).

## Enable Microphone

- The Recorder component auto-starts by default. Configure mic settings via:

- Transmit Enabled: Toggle voice activity.

- Voice Detection (VAD): Auto-mutes when silent.

- Codec Settings: Adjust bitrate/sampling (Opus recommended).

## 3D Spatial Audio (Optional)

- Enable Recorder.LocalVoice.SetSpatializerOptions() for positional voice.

- Mute/Volume Control

Use photonView.RPC to send mute commands or adjust Speaker.Volume.
